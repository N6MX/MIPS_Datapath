      Number using O6 output only:             352
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    0
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   3,664    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   197 out of   3,758    5%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   7,516    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          693
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           181 out of     693   26%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 341 out of     693   49%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         171 out of     693   24%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  30,064    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
